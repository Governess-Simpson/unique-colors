# unique-colors

## Description

Developed a basic web application where users can select their favorite color from a pre-selected list; afterward, the site displays variants of that color, and users can select the text to see the color in the background. The goal of the project was two-fold:

1. Allow users to experience colors they normally wouldn't have / expand their cocability with new colors.
2. Start building my portfolio + gaining experience in web development.

This project was time-boxed to be completed in one week.

**Stack**: Front-End
**Languages**: HTML, CSS, Vanilla JS

No installation needed!
