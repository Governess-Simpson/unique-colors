# unique-colors

## Description

**WORKFLOW:**

Developed a basic web application where users can select their favorite color from a pre-selected list; afterward, the site displays variants of that color, and users can select the text to see the color in the background. The goal of the project was two-fold:

1. Allow users to experience colors they normally wouldn't have / expand their cocability with new colors.
2. Start building my portfolio + gaining experience in web development.

This project was time-boxed to be completed in one week.

**UNDER THE HOOD:**

Stack: Front-End
Languages: HTML, CSS, Vanilla JS

No installation needed!

**LESSONS LEARNED**
1. I wanted to start learning front-end development with the basics (plain JS, HTML/CSS) so that I can build upon the basics in future projects. This gave me a good grasp of those concepts that I can build upon in other frameworks.

**FUTURE IMPROVEMENTS**
1. General polish of the page: This was my first crack at front-end design, and it shows! I'd like to revisit this project and make the UI cleaner and less scrambled together.
2. Increase the number of colors: I started with 4 main colors (each with 3 unique ones); the next step is to increase this so it's accessible to more users.
3. On-hover: When I approach a unique color, I'd like the background to slowly transition to the color (as opposed to a hard color change on-click).
